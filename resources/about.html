                <h1>About Me</h1>
                <p>Hello there, my name is Austin Nash and I am an aspiring web developer. I studied Computer 
                Science at Juniata College and graduated with a 3.50 GPA. While at college, I played Division III football.
                From my experience playing college football and managing school at the same time, I developed a strong work ethic 
                and great time management skills. After college, I continued my education by taking Codecademy's Full Stack Development course 
                to help me get experience in web development so I can be prepared and ready to become a developer. During this time, I also worked at a 
                local hospital as a transporter.
                </p>
